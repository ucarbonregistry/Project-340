1.10 MW Solar Rooftop Project of Kayaar Exports Private Limited
The project “1.10 MW Solar Rooftop Project of Kayaar Exports Private Limited” is located in
Village K.R.Nagar, Tehsil Kovilpatti, District Thoothukudi, State Tamil Nadu, Country India.

Purpose of the project activity:
The project activity is an installation of a rooftop 1.10 MW solar power plant on roof of the project
developer to generate clean electricity utilizing solar energy. The electricity generated from project
activity is evacuated to the industry for own captive consumption, thus replacing the equivalent
amount of electricity, generated from the operation of existing grid connected power plants (mostly
fossil fuel based).

The project activity is implemented on the rooftop of Kayaar Exports Private Limited, situated at
Thoothukudi district of Tamil Nadu in India. The main purpose of the project activity is to generate
electrical energy through sustainable means using solar power resources, thus the generated green
electricity will contribute to climate change mitigation efforts. The Project activity comprising of
1.10 MW solar rooftop project was commissioned on 29.03.2019 by M/s. Kayaar Exports Private
Limited (Project Developer).

In absence of the project activity, equivalent amount of electricity which is imported by the project
developer for own consumption would have been imported from the grid by fossil fuel based power
plant connected to this grid. The project activity is expected to supply approximately 1948 MWh of
renewable power to the consumer facility each year. Hence, the project activity is expected to
reduce the anthropogenic emission by 1754 t-CO2e/Yr
